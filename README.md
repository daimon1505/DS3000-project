# DS3000-project

## Downloading the Files onto your computer

- To download these files open your terminal in MacOS or powershell on Windows and type ```git clone https://github.com/yashjay1/DS3000-project/```
- Once you've done that, the files will be downloaded onto your computer into a folder called **DS3000-project**. Go to your root directory (directory means folder).
  - To find your root directory (topmost folder), you can type ```ls``` to list the files in that folder to get more context.
 
## Uploading your changes or files onto GitHub

- Once you're done with your changes, add any new files or the recently changed files into the folder **DS3000-project** from the previous step.
- Then open your terminal/powershell and type ```cd DS3000-project```. Now you're inside that folder through your terminal/powershell.
- Next, type ```git add .```. This will add all the files that needs to be uploaded.
- Type ```git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE"``` and type a message about your changes in the double quotes. This will be shown on Github with the added/changed files.
- To finally upload your files, type ```git push```


## Extra points to remember
- Do not move the **DS3000-project** folder since it can be difficult to navigate using the terminal/powershell.
- You may need to type ```pip install git``` if you have never used Git or Github before.
